                    <p><b>1.The Five Grand Palaces</b> <br><br>
                        There are five Joseon Royal Palaces in Seoul – Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung, Changgyeonggung, Gyeonghuigung, and Deoksugung. We visited only the first two but you can easily visit all five if you like.
    
                        Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung are the biggest and arguably the most beautiful of the five. Gyeongbokgung was the primary palace and one of just two (the other being Deoksugung) where you can watch the changing of the Royal Guard. Equally impressive is Changdeokgung which is a UNESCO Heritage Site and home to the Huwon or “Secret Garden”.<br><br>
    
                        Check out my article on Changdeokgung and Gyeongbokgung palaces for more pictures and information. You can visit on your own or go on a guided tour (Klook | Get Your Guide). If you plan on visiting multiple palaces on your own, then you may want to invest in an Integrated Palace Ticket.

                        As ultramodern a metropolis as Seoul is, it’s nice to find a place like this right in the middle of the city. Bukchon Hanok Village is an atmospheric labyrinth of narrow alleyways and traditional Korean houses called hanoks.<br><br>
                        Exploring its network of streets will take you back in time and give you a glimpse of what Seoul was like 600 years ago. Like the royal palaces, it’s one of the best places in Seoul to rent a hanbok and level up your Instagram game.<br><br>
                        Check out my article on Bukchon Hanok Village for more pictures and information. If you’d like to learn more about Bukchon Hanok Village, then you may be interested in joining this free walking tour or going with a guide.<br><br>

                    When it comes to great views, this place towers above the competition. Standing 480 meters (1,575 ft) above sea level, N Seoul Tower’s observation deck is the best place to get bird’s eye views of the city.<br><br>
                    N Seoul Tower is located on Mt. Namsan and accessible via road or cable car, though most tourists will opt for the latter. You can purchase tickets to the observatory at the gate or in advance through Klook or Get Your Guide.<br><br>

                        <p><b>4. Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP)</b><br><br> 
                        This place is incredible. If you like design, any kind of design, then you need to put Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) on your itinerary. It’s like a museum, design supermarket, and space ship all rolled into one.<br><br>
                        DDP was designed by the late Zaha Hadid, the renowned architect who created the 2012 Olympic aquatic centre in London and the Guangzhou Opera House in China.
                        I suggest devoting several hours to this place if you can. Be sure to come back at night as well when the building really comes to life. Check out my article on Dongdaemun Design Plaza for more pictures and information.<br><br>
