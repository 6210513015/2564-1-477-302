            <h1>1.Dress Up in a Hanbok</h1><br><br>
               <p>If you’re a fan of Korean period dramas or just the culture in general, then you’ll probably want a selfie wearing a hanbok. It’s the traditional Korean form of dress worn by both men and women during festivals and celebrations.<br><br>

                Bukchon Hanok Village and any of the five royal palaces make for great photo backdrops. You’ll find a few hanbok rental shops around those areas but you can also rent one in advance through Klook.<br><br></p>

            <h1>2. Visit a Market</h1><br><br>
            <p>We love visiting markets on trips because they’re often the best places to find great street food in any city. Seoul is no exception with its many interesting markets like Noryangjin Fish Market, Gwangjang Market (pictured below), and Nandaemun Market. Check them out if you’re looking for cheap and authentic street food in Seoul.<br><br></p>

            <h1>3. Explore Seoul’s Neighborhoods</h1><br><br>
            <p>Seoul is a massive city with many interesting neighborhoods. Four of its most popular include Insadong, Myeongdong, Hongdae, and Itaewon, each with its own distinct personality.<br><br>
                Insadong is known for its traditional arts and crafts, Myeongdong for its brand names and cosmetics, Hongdae for its trendy college town atmosphere, and Itaeown for its international vibe. All have terrific food.<br><br>
                Check out my article on Seoul’s neighborhoods for more pictures and information.<br><br></p>

            <h1>4. Take a Stroll Along Cheonggyecheon Stream</h1><br><br>
            <p>Cheonggyecheon Stream is an 11 km stream that runs through the heart of downtown Seoul. It passes underneath 22 bridges and through a number of city landmarks before opening up into the Han River. It’s a popular picture-taking spot in Seoul and a great place to cool off in the summer.<br><br>
                You can walk along the stream on your own, but if you’d like to learn more about it and the places you’ll be passing along the way, then you may be interested in joining this free walking tour.<br><br></p>

            <h1>5. Go on a K-pop/Kdrama Tour</h1><br><br>
            <p>As described, many people have been turned on to South Korea because of the popularity of Korean pop music and its film and television industry. In fact, we know of a few diehard fans who routinely fly to Seoul just to attend music concerts!<br><br>
                If you have a fascination for Korean pop culture, then you may be interested in booking a K-pop tour (Klook | Get Your Guide). You may find a few sightseeing tours as well that take you to filming spots made popular by hit television dramas.<br><br></p>

              <h1>6. Watch the Cookin’ Nanta Show</h1><br><br>
              <p> If you’d like to watch a show or performance in Seoul, then the Cookin’ Nanta Show is one to consider. It’s entertaining and funny and reminds me of a Korean version of Stomp, but with food.<br><br>
                There are two Nanta theaters – one in Myeongdong and another in Hongdae. You can purchase tickets at the gate but you can sometimes get a discount if you buy them in advance through Klook.<br><br></p>

              <h1>7. Take a Cooking Class</h1><br><br>
              <p>We haven’t done this in Korea but taking a cooking class is something we try to do on every trip. It’s a fun, hands-on way of getting to know the local cuisine.<br><br>
                If you’re interested in taking a cooking class in Seoul, then I suggest searching for one on Cookly. Cookly is an online booking platform that offers cooking classes in many cities around the world, including Seoul.<br><br></p>
