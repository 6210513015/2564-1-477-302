                    <p><b>SEOUL TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS</b><br><br>
                        Because of the current global situation, Seoul travel guidelines seem to change on a daily basis. Our friends at Booking.com created a website that lists detailed information on travel restrictions around the globe.<br><br>
                        Before planning a trip to Seoul, be sure to check Booking.com for information on travel restrictions to South Korea. If you do decide to visit Seoul, then you may want to seriously consider getting travel insurance with COVID coverage.<br><br>
    
                       <b>SOUTH KOREA VISA</b><br><br> 
                       You may need a visa and other travel documents to visit South Korea depending on your passport. Check out iVisa.com to learn about the requirements and to apply for a visa (if necessary).<br><br>
                       If you’re a Philippine passport holder living in Manila, then check out our guide on how to apply for a South Korea visa for a step-by-step process.<br><br>
    
                       <b>WHERE TO EXCHANGE CURRENCY</b><br><br> 
                       The unit of currency in Seoul is the Korean Won (KRW).<br><br>
                       <b>Myeongdong</b> is the best place to exchange your currency. There are plenty of money changers in the area and they’re known to give the best rates in the city. We scoped out a few other areas and the rates were never as good.<br><br>
                       I suggest changing a small amount at the airport, no more than USD 100, just to get you in to the city. You can then change the rest in Myeongdong.<br><br>
                       A better option these days is to withdraw KRW from an ATM. The rates are competitive, sometimes even better. Just be sure to let your bank know that you’ll be using your ATM card abroad so you don’t run into any problems. In my experience, my ATM card works in some machines but not in others. I didn’t have any problems using it in Seoul.<br><br>
                       <b>TIP:</b> Some ATM machines may ask you if you’d like to proceed “with or without conversion”. Always choose WITHOUT conversion. Proceeding “with conversion” allows the foreign bank operating the ATM to perform the conversion at rates favorable to them. According to this article, the difference in rates can be as high as 10%.<br><br>
    
                       <b>HOW TO GET AROUND IN SEOUL</b><br><br>
                       Seoul’s subway system is very efficient, so much so that you probably won’t need any other form of transportation when you’re there. We never took a taxi and the only times we ever got on a bus was to go to places outside of Seoul like Paju, Suwon, and Jinhae.<br><br>
                       It can be a little confusing at first but as long as you remember your destination’s subway stop and the line number that it’s on, then you shouldn’t have any problems.<br><br>
                       You sometimes have to walk far to transfer between lines so it’s important to know the line number of your stop. Otherwise, you won’t know which way to go to transfer lines. Whenever I include directions in our Seoul travel guides, I always try to indicate Line and Exit numbers.<br><br>
                       It’s a good idea to invest in a T-money card. It’s a transportation card that eliminates the hassle of buying single journey tokens, plus it saves you KRW 100 per journey. It can be used to transfer between subway lines, buses, or from subway to bus and vice versa (within a transfer time limit) at no extra charge.<br><br>
                       The card itself costs KRW 2,500 and it can be purchased at most convenience stores and subway stations. You can top it up with any amount at recharge stations found at every subway stop. If there’s any amount left over at the end of your trip, then you can have it refunded at a convenience store or refund station (minus a KRW 500 service charge).<br><br>
                       Another option is to get a Korea Tour Card which is a variation of the T-money card. It has the same benefits as the T-money card, plus it gives you small discounts at some tourist spots, shopping centers, restaurants, and theaters.<br><br>
                       We usually navigate with Google Maps but it doesn’t work as well in Seoul. It has something to do with street names being changed recently (or something like that) so it’s best to navigate with the NAVER Map instead (iOS | Android).<br><br>
                       
                       <b>BUDGET / SUMMARY OF EXPENSES</b><br><br> 
                       I was a bit surprised after our first trip to Seoul in 2015 because the city turned out to be less expensive than I thought. But that was probably because we ate street food most of the time and only visited a handful of restaurants. In reality, Seoul is more like Osaka when it comes to travel costs.
                       Assuming you’ll be staying in Seoul for 5 full days and sharing inexpensive accommodations with one other person, then a daily budget of around KRW 65,000-70,000 per person should be good. This takes into account your accommodations, transportation, modest meals, and pocket wifi rental. Here’s a quick breakdown of expenses:<br><br>
                       <b>ACCOMMODATIONS</b> Everyone has their preferences, but on our most recent trip, we stayed at a guesthouse in Hongdae for around KRW 60,000 per night. This is the room rate for two people for a room with a private bathroom. Expect to pay considerably less if you’re staying at a hostel.<br><br>
                       <b>MEALS</b> This is also subjective but based on our experience, I’d say around KRW 30,000 a day per person. Inexpensive but filling dishes like gomtang or seolnongtang typically cost between KRW 10,000-15,000. Add more to your budget if you plan on eating Korean BBQ.<br><br>
                       <b>POCKET WIFI RENTAL</b> If you’re sharing the cost with one other person, then you’ll each be paying around KRW 1,500 per day.<br><br>
                       <b>TRANSPORTATION</b> If you have a T-money card and use the subway, then you’ll be paying at least KRW 1,250 per journey. Assuming you’ll be taking around three subway journeys per day, expect to spend about KRW 4,000 a day for transportation.<br><br>
                       <b>TOTAL</b> This comes out to around KRW 65,500 a day per person. Keep in mind that this baseline estimate doesn’t include tour costs, entrance fees, or shopping. Be sure to add the cost of any tours you want to do to this amount. Ren and I are middle of the road travelers who enjoy good food and drink, so the recommended budget is a good baseline for travelers like us. Adjust accordingly based on your own travel habits.<br><br>
    
                       <b>SEOUL TRAVEL TIPS</b><br><br>
                       <b>1. Plan your Trip with Sygic Travel</b> Some people may find trip planning a little tedious or daunting. This free trip planning can make it easier and more fun.
                       What Sygic Travel does is allow you to visualize everything on a map, so you can easily group places of interest by location and put them all together in an efficient itinerary. Check out my article on the Sygic Travel app for more information.<br><br>
                       <b>2. Rent a Pocket Wifi Device</b> A constant wifi connection is a necessity these days, especially when you’re away on a trip. You’ll need it to translate, do research, use ride-sharing apps, and find your favorite K-drama filming locations. We never go anywhere now without renting a pocket wifi device first.
                       You can stay connected in Seoul by renting a pocket wifi device or buying a sim card. We always rent pocket wifi devices but sim cards are perfectly fine too. They’re even cheaper.
                       Regardless of your preference, you can rent a pocket wifi device or buy a sim card through Klook. If you’re in Asia, then be sure to go through the list as it may be cheaper to pick it up from your origin country.<br><br>
                       <b>3. Get an Integrated Palace Ticket</b> If you want to visit as many palaces as you can in Seoul, then you should definitely get an integrated palace ticket. Entrance to four major palaces — Changdeokgung (including Huwon), Changgyeonggung, Deoksugung, Gyeongbokgung — plus Jongmyo Shrine will normally cost you a total of KRW 17,000 for adults. With the integrated palace ticket, you’ll have access to all five for just KRW 10,000.<br><br>
                       <b>4. Check for Discount Passes</b> I love going through e-commerce sites to find travel deals. I’ve bought vouchers from several different websites but for Seoul, my favorites are Klook, Get Your Guide, and KKday. They have the widest selection at the best prices.
                       If you’re looking for deals on tours, shows, theme parks, and airport transfers in Seoul, then check out Klook, Get Your Guide, and KKday. Even if I don’t buy anything, I often find interesting activities that I may not think of myself so it’s always worth a look.<br><br>
                       <b>5. Get Travel Insurances</b> Whether or not to get travel insurance depends on where we’re going, how long we’re staying there, and most importantly, what we’ll be doing. If all we’re doing is visiting Hong Kong and feasting on street food for a few days, then we may not get it. But if we plan on doing more physical things, things that could get us hurt, then we’ll definitely get travel insurance.
                       We buy insurance from World Nomads or SafetyWing. They’re both reliable travel medical insurance providers used by many long-term travelers. Check out my article on why we buy travel insurance for more information. You can follow the links to get a free quote from World Nomads or SafetyWing.<br><br>
                       <b>6. Bring the Right Power Adapter</b> Electrical outlets in South Korea are round so plugs are typically Type C or Type F. Be sure to bring the right power adapters for your devices. Electrical voltage is 220/230V.
